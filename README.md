# LSTM-LipReading
This is a novel approach for lip-reading solution, which extracts the geometrical shape of lip movement from the video and predicts the words/sentences spoken. 
An Indian specific language data set is developed which consists of lip movement information captured from 50 persons. 
This includes students in the age group of 18 to 20 years and faculty in the age group of 25 to 40 years. 
All have spoken a paragraph of 58 words within 10 sentences in Hindi (Devanagari, spoken in India) language which was recorded under various conditions. 
The implementation consists of facial parts detection, along with Long short term memoryâ€™s. 
The proposed solution is able to predict the words spoken with 77% and 35% accuracy for data set of 3 and 10 words respectively. 
The sentences are predicted with 20% accuracy, which is encouraging.

Note: This is a research project still under development.
